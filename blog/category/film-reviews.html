<p>This is very powerful Australian short film that gives a brief insight into the life of a seemingly depressed and troubled teenager in a typical suburban setting. Visually it&#8217;s most impressive, despite the obvious low budget, with some fantastic night footage. I&#8217;m a big fan of the use of red light to highlight the freeways&#8230;</p>

<p>This is a truly fantastic film about an attractive young woman called Eva that lives at her parent&#8217;s home with her brother and is coming to terms with adulthood and love. Eva blends the joys and confusions of growing up with the sadness and restriction of living in a country under brutal dictatorship (Romania). It&#8217;s&#8230;</p>

<p>This is a film based on a true story of a Catholic priest and a young idealistic English teacher who found themselves caught up in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
