                <p><strong>LateNite Films Pty Ltd</strong> is committed to ensuring the health and safety of each Participant who performs work on all of its projects.</p>
              <p>We have a zero tolerance for any form of sexual harassment.</p>
              <p>Under the <strong>Sex Discrimination Act 1984</strong> and state legislation it is against the law for a person to sexually harass another person. Some forms of sexual harassment, including sexual assault and indecent exposure, are also crimes and will be reported to the police.</p>
            <p>LateNite Films Pty Ltd has appointed Chris Hocking as the sexual harassment prevention contact. Chris Hocking is available to any Participant involved in the making of all projects and is also available to anyone applying or auditioning for a role on the Project. Chris Hocking can be contacted via: <a href="mailto:chris@latenitefilms.com">chris@latenitefilms.com</a>.</p>
            <p>You should report any conduct that you believe is sexual harassment, whether it is against you or another person, to your supervisor or to Chris Hocking directly. Alternatively, you can also contact anyone else from the LateNite Films team via: <a href="{{ relBase }}contact/" target="_contact">"{{ relBase }}contact/</a></p>
            <p>You also have the right to seek advice or assistance from others (such as your union or lawyer), or seek assistance from or make a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission.</p>
            <p>LateNite Films Pty Ltd assures you that timely, fair and appropriate action will be taken to address any complaint. Victimisation of any Participant who raises a complaint is unlawful.</p>
            <h4>It is very important to speak up.</h4>
            <p>All Participants have a responsibility to promote appropriate standards of behaviour at all times. This includes during work hours while working on the Project and out-of-hours while attending work-related functions.</p>
            <p>Participants can be personally liable for engaging in sexual harassment.
                <h4>Sexual harassment is:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any unwanted, unwelcome or uninvited behaviour of a sexual nature, which makes a person feel offended, humiliated or intimidated.</li>
                    <li>Includes staring or leering, unnecessary familiarity, such as deliberately brushing up against you or unwelcome touching, suggestive comments or jokes, insults or taunts of a sexual nature, intrusive questions or statements about your private life, displaying posters, magazines or screen savers of a sexual nature, sending sexually explicit emails or text messages, inappropriate advances on social networking sites, accessing sexually explicit internet sites, requests for sex or repeated unwanted requests to go out on dates.</li>
                    <li>Behaviour that may also be considered to be an offence under criminal law, such as physical assault, indecent exposure, sexual assault, stalking or obscene communications.</li>
                    <li>Behaviour of a sexual nature which you agree or consent to, such as flirting, is not sexual harassment. If the interaction is consensual, welcome and reciprocated it is not sexual harassment.</li>
                    <li>Sexual harassment disproportionately affects women with 1 in 5 experiencing sexual harassment in the workplace at some time. However, 1 in 20 men also report experiencing sexual harassment in the workplace.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
