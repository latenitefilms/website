                            times. This includes during work hours while working on the Project and out-of-hours while

                        <h3>OUR PRINCIPLES OF DATA PROTECTION:</h3>
                        <p>Our approach to data protection is built around four key principles. They&#39;re at the heart
                            of everything we do relating to personal data.</p>
                        <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> We take a human approach to how we process personal data by
                            being open, honest and transparent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Enablement:</strong> We enable connections and efficient use of personal data to
                            empower productivity and growth.</p>
                        <p><strong>Security:</strong> We champion industry leading approaches to securing the personal
                            data entrusted to us.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stewardship:</strong> We accept the responsibility that comes with processing
                            personal data.</p>
                        <h3>HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY LATENITE FILMS?</h3>
                        <h4>LateNite Films primarily collects personal information:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>from an individual directly when details are provided to us in emails, forms,
                                face-to-face meetings, interviews, business cards and telephone conversations; and/or
                            </li>
                            <li>from public records such as ASIC&#39;s database and IP Australia&#39;s database; and
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We will take reasonable steps to notify individuals about our collection of their personal
                            information, and will provide all relevant information prescribed under the Privacy Act.</p>
                        <p>We will only collect personal information by lawful and fair means. We will destroy or
                            de-identify any personal information we receive if we would not ordinarily be permitted to
                            collect that information under the Privacy Act.</p>
                        <h3>WHAT KINDS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ARE COLLECTED BY LATENITE FILMS?</h3>
                        <p>The personal information we may collect about individuals includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>name and company name;</li>
                            <li>general contact information such as address, telephone, fax and email.

                        </ul>
                        <h3>COOKIES</h3>
                        <p>Similar to other commercial Websites, our website utilises a standard technology called
                            &quot;cookies&quot; (see explanation below, &quot;What Are Cookies?&quot;) and web server log files to collect
                            information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and web
                            server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our
                            Website, and the Websites visited just before and just after our Website.</p>
                        <h4>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.
                            When you visit a Website, that site&#39;s computer asks your computer for permission to
                            store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each
                            Website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser&#39;s preferences allow it,
                            but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Website to access the cookies it
                            has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually
                            set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter
                            the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser
                            refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively
                            when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or
                            pass on computer viruses.</p>
                        <h4>HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM COOKIES?</h4>
                        <p>As you visit and browse our website, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other
                            users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is
                            necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server&#39;s log files, allow
                            us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the
                            site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our website and
                            better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about
                            you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to
                            us in your cookies.</p>
                        <h4>IP ADDRESSES</h4>
                        <p>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP
                            address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP
                            addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile
                            data known as traffic data so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to
                            you.</p>
                        <h3>EMBEDDED CONTENT FROM OTHER WEBSITES</h3>
                        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).
                            Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has
                            visited the other website.</p>
                        <p>

                            These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party
                            tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your
                            interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that
                            website.
